<h1>Astronomy</h1>
<p>In the field of Astronomy if you ask a scientist that... how was our universe formed? How did it come into existence? He will tell you about the Big Bang Theory that initially the whole universe
    was one<b>‘Primary Nebula’</b>. Then there was a secondary separation which gave rise to galaxies, which further split to form things such as our solar system, which gave rise to planets, the Sun
    and the present Earth which we live in.

    This verse of the Holy Qur'an speaks about the Big Bang Theory, in a nutshell. Imagine, what we came to know today, the Holy Qur'an mentions 1400 years ago.
</p>
<p>And the Qur'an also says in Surah Fussilat, Chapter No. 41, verse 11, that:</p>
<div class="reference">
    {{REF_AR=41:11}}
    <p class="translation">{{REF_TR=41:11}}</p>

    The Arabic word used here is <b>‘Dukhan’</b>, which means <b>‘Smoke’</b>. If you ask a
    scientist, he will tell you that the
    universe before it was formed, the celestial matter, it was in the state of <b>‘gas’</b>, and
    the Arabic word <b>‘Dukhan’</b>
    which means Smoke, is more scientifically correct than mere <b>‘gas’</b>. And according to
    Stephen Hawkins, who is a
    very
    famous scientist, he said “the discovery of bridges of matter in the space is the biggest
    discovery of this
    century
    which gives us indisputable evidence of the creation, of the universe and the Big Bang Theory”.

<h3>THE EARTH IS ROUND</h3>
<p>
    Previously the people thought that the world we live in, it is flat and they were afraid to
    venture too far,
    lest
    they would fall over. It was only in 1577, when Sir Francis Drake when he sailed around the
    earth he proved that
    the
    world was spherical.
    <br>
    <br>
    The Qur'an mentions in Surah Luqman, Chapter No. 31, Verse 29:
</p>
<div class="reference">
    {{REF_AR=31:29}}
    <p class="translation">{{REF_TR=31:29}}</p>
    <div class="footer">

    Merging is a slow and gradual process. The night slowly and gradually changes to day, and the
    day slowly and
    gradually changes to night. This phenomena is only possible if the shape of the earth is
    spherical, It’s not
    possible if it is flat. If it was flat there will be a sudden change.
    <br>
    <br>
    The Qur'an says in Surah Az-Zumar, Chapter No. 39, Verse No. 5, it says:
</p>
<div class="reference">
    {{REF_AR=39:5}}
    <p class="translation">{{REF_TR=39:5}}</p>
    <div class="footer">
        <span>{{REF_NAME=39:5}}</span>

    The Arabic word used is, <b>‘Kawwara’</b> which means overlapping or coiling. How you coil a
    turban around the head,
    How
    you overlap a turban around the head. This phenomena of the night overlapping and coiling over
    the day is only
    possible if the shape of the earth is spherical. It is not possible if the shape of earth is
    flat there will be
    a
    sudden change.
</p>
<p>
    The Holy Qur'an further says in Surah Naziat, Chapter No. 79, Verse No. 30, it says:
</p>
<div class="reference">
    {{REF_AR=79:30}}
    <p class="translation">{{REF_TR=79:30}}</p>
    <div class="footer">

    The Arabic word <b>‘Dahaha’</b> comes from root word <b>‘Duhya’</b>, meaning an Egg-shape and it
    does not refer to any normal
    Egg.
    It specifically refers to the Egg of an Ostrich and today we know that the world is not
    completely round like a
    ball, it is Geo Spherical. It is slightly flattened from the top and bulging from the centre,
    it’s Geo
    Spherical.
    And if you analyze the shape of the Egg of an Ostrich - it too is Geo Spherical, slightly
    flattened from the top
    and
    bulging from the centre. So the Holy Qur'an describes the exact <b>‘Geo Spherical earth’</b>
    1400 years ago.

<h3>THE MOON IS REFLECTING LIGHT</h3>
<p>
    Previously we thought that the light of the Moon is its own light. It’s recently we discovered
    that the light of
    the
    Moon is reflected light of the Sun.
    <br>
    <br>

    The similar message is repeated in <a href="https://quranapp.verse.ref/71/15-16">Surah Nuh, Chapter No. 71, Verse No. 15 to 16</a>
    <br>
    <br>
    The Arabic word for Sun is <b>‘Shams’</b>. It's always described either as <b>‘Siraj’</b>
    meaning a torch, or <b>‘Wahaj’</b> meaning
    a
    blazing lamp, or <b>‘Diya’</b> meaning a shining glory.
    <br>
    <br>
    The Moon, the Arabic word is <b>‘Qamar’</b>. It's always described as <b>‘Munir’</b>, meaning
    borrowed light or <b>‘Noor’</b>, which
    is a
    reflection of light. Nowhere is the moon light described as <b>‘Siraj’</b> or <b>‘Wahaj’</b> or
    <b>‘Diya’</b> always as <b>‘Munir’</b> or
    <b>‘Noor’</b>
    that's borrowed light or a reflection of light.

<h3>THE PLANETS REVOLVE AND ROTATE</h3>
<p>
    Previously the Europeans, they thought that the Earth stood dead, in the centre of the Universe
    and all the
    planets
    including the Sun, it revolved around the earth. It was known as the theory of 'Geocentrism'. It
    was believed by
    Ptolemy in the second century BC, and was believed till as late as 16th century, until
    Copernicus said that the
    Earth and the planets revolve around the Sun. And later on, in 1609 Yuhanas Kepler wrote in his
    book,
    ‘Astronomia
    Nova’ … that not only do the earth and the planets revolve around the Sun, they also rotate
    about their own
    axis.
    <br>
    <br>
    Previously it was taught that the Sun was fixed, it did not rotate about its own axis.
    <br>
    <br>
    But the Holy Qur'an says in Surah Al-Anbiya, Chapter No. 21, Verse No. 33:
</p>
<div class="reference">
    {{REF_AR=21:33}}
    <p class="translation">{{REF_TR=21:33}}</p>
    <div class="footer">

    The Arabic word <b>‘Yasbahoon’</b>, is derived from the word <b>‘Sabaha’</b>, which describes
    the motion of a moving body. If
    I
    say that a man is doing <b>‘Sabaha’</b> on the ground, it will not mean that he is rolling, it
    will mean he is either
    walking or running. If I say a person is doing <b>‘Sabaha’</b> in the water, it will not mean he
    is floating, it will
    mean
    he is swimming. Similarly, when the Qur'an uses the word <b>‘Yasbahoon’</b> derived from <b>‘Sabaha’</b>,
    for a celestial body
    it
    will not mean… it is flying, it will mean, it is rotating about its own axis. And today we have
    come to know
    with
    the help of an equipment, we can have the image of the Sun on the table top, and we see there
    are black spots
    and it
    takes approximately 25 days for these black spots to complete one rotation indicating that the
    Sun takes
    approximately 25 days to complete one rotation.
    <br>
    <br>
    Can you imagine the Qur'an speaks about the rotation and the
    revolution of the Sun 1400 years ago, which science has discovered today.
    <br>
    <br>
    The Holy Qur'an says in Surah Yasin, Chapter No. 36, Verse No. 40:

    What does the Qur'an mean by saying it is not permitted for the Sun to catch up with the Moon...
    previously
    people
    thought that the orbit of the Sun and the Moon was the same. But Qur'an gives the indication…
    No! the orbit of
    the
    Sun and the Moon, is different. The question of catching up does not arise and each of them, the
    Sun and the
    Moon,
    they rotate as well as revolve.

    The Arabic word, <b>‘Mustakar’</b>, means to a place determined, for a period determined.
    <br>
    <br>
    Today science has come to know that the Sun, along with the Solar system, it is going towards a
    point in the
    Universe which the scientists call as the <b>‘Solar Apex’</b>. And it's moving at a speed of 12
    miles per second, and
    it is
    going to a point which they call as <b>‘A point in the constellation of Hercules’</b>.
    <br>
    <br>
    This same message is repeated in:

<h3>THE UNIVERSE IS EXPANDING</h3>
<p>
    The Qur'an says in Surah Dhariat, Chapter No. 51, Verse No. 47, that:

<div class="reference">

    The Arabic word <b>‘Musioona’</b> means expanding universe, the vastness of space.
    <br>
    <br>
    Edwin Aero, who is a famous scientist,
    he discovered and said that <b>‘the universe is expanding’</b>. The galaxies are receding from
    one another which the
    Qur'an
    has mentioned 1400 years ago.
    <br>
    <br>
    There may be some people who say… It is nothing great that the Holy Qur'an speaks about
    Astronomy, since the
    Arabs,
    they were very well advanced in the field of Astronomy. It is to bring to their notice that it
    was centuries
    after the Holy Qur'an was revealed that the Arabs became advanced in Astronomy. So it is from
    the Qur'an, that
    the
    Arabs learnt about Astronomy, and not the vice versa.
